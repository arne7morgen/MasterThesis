We propose a novel approach for multiperson tracking-by-detection in a particle filtering framework. In addition to final high-confidence detections, our algorithm uses the continuous confidence of pedestrian detectors and online-trained, instance-specific classifiers as a graded observation model. Thus, generic object category knowledge is complemented by instance-specific information. The main contribution of this paper is to explore how these unreliable information sources can be used for robust multiperson tracking. The algorithm detects and tracks a large number of dynamically moving people in complex scenes with occlusions, does not rely on background modeling, requires no camera or ground plane calibration, and only makes use of information from the past. Hence, it imposes very few restrictions and is suitable for online applications. Our experiments show that the method yields good tracking performance in a large variety of highly dynamic scenarios, such as typical surveillance videos, webcam footage, or sports sequences. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other methods that rely on additional information. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of different algorithm components on the robustness.},

	abstract = {Bayesian analysis is applied to detect change points in the time series of annual tropical cyclone counts over the central North Pacific. Specifically, a hierarchical Bayesian approach involving three layers—data, parameter, and hypothesis—is formulated to demonstrate the posterior probability of the shifts throughout the time from 1966 to 2002. For the data layer, a Poisson process with gamma distributed intensity is presumed. For the hypothesis layer, a “no change in the intensity” hypothesis and a “single change in the intensity” hypothesis are considered. Results indicate that there is a great likelihood of a change point on tropical cyclone rates around 1982, which is consistent with earlier work based on a simple log-linear regression model. A Bayesian approach also provides a means for predicting decadal tropical cyclone variations. A higher number of tropical cyclones is predicted in the next decade when the possibility of the change point in the early 1980s is taken into account.},

	abstract = {A sequence of observations undergoes sudden changes at unknown times. We model the process by supposing that there is an underlying sequence of parameters partitioned into contiguous blocks of equal parameter values; the beginning of each block is said to be a change point. Observations are then assumed to be independent in different blocks given the sequence of parameters. In a Bayesian analysis it is necessary to give probability distributions to both the change points and the parameters. We use product partition models (Barry and Hartigan 1992), which assume that the probability of any partition is proportional to a product of prior cohesions, one for each block in the partition, and that given the blocks the parameters in different blocks have independent prior distributions. Given the observations a new product partition model holds, with posterior cohesions for the blocks and new independent block posterior distributions for parameters. The product model thus provides a convenient machinery for allowing the data to weight the partitions likely to hold; inference about particular parameters may then be made by first conditioning on the partition, and then averaging over all partitions. The parameter values may be estimated exactly in O(n3) calculations, or to an adequate approximation by Markov sampling techniques that are O(n) in the number of observations. The Markov sampling computations are thus practicable for long sequences. We compare this model with a number of alternative approaches to fitting change points and parameters when the error distribution is normal, then show that the proposed method is superior to the alternatives in detecting sharp short-lived changes in the parameters.},

	abstract = {Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.},

This technique, compared to the conventional CGH, significantly improves the identification of chromosomal abnormalities. However, due to the random noise inherited in the imaging and hybridization process, identifying statistically significant DNA copy number changes in aCGH data is challenging. We propose a novel approach that uses the mean and variance change point model (MVCM) to detect CNVs or breakpoints in aCGH data sets. We derive an approximate p-value for the test statistic and also give the estimate of the locus of the DNA copy number change. We carry out simulation studies to evaluate the accuracy of the estimate and the p-value formulation. These simulation results show that the approach is effective in identifying copy number changes. The approach is also tested on fibroblast cancer cell line data, breast tumor cell line data, and breast cancer cell line aCGH data sets that are publicly available. Changes that have not been identified by the circular binary segmentation (CBS) method but are biologically verified are detected by our approach on these cell lines with higher sensitivity and specificity than CBS.},

	abstract = {It is now over a decade since the pioneering contribution of Gordon (1993), which is commonly regarded as the first instance of modern sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches. Initially focussed on applications to tracking and vision, these techniques are now very widespread and have had a significant impact in virtually all areas of signal and image processing concerned with Bayesian dynamical models. This paper is intended to serve both as an introduction to SMC algorithms for nonspecialists and as a reference to recent contributions in domains where the techniques are still under significant development, including smoothing, estimation of fixed parameters and use of SMC methods beyond the standard filtering contexts.},

	abstract = {We propose an on-line algorithm for exact filtering of multiple changepoint problems. This algorithm enables simulation from the true joint posterior distribution of the number and position of the changepoints for a class of changepoint models. The computational cost of this exact algorithm is quadratic in the number of observations. We further show how resampling ideas from particle filters can be used to reduce the computational cost to linear in the number of observations, at the expense of introducing small errors, and we propose two new, optimum resampling algorithms for this problem. One, a version of rejection control, allows the particle filter to choose the number of particles that are required at each time step automatically. The new resampling algorithms substantially outperform standard resampling algorithms on examples that we consider; and we demonstrate how the resulting particle filter is practicable for segmentation of human G+C content.},

This paper proposes an on-line (causal) novelty detection method capable of detecting both outliers and regime change points in sequential time-series data. Our approach is based on a Kalman filter in order to model time-series data and extreme value theory is used to compute a novelty measure in a principled manner. The proposed approach is shown to be effective via experiments on several real-world data sets.},

	abstract = {Change detection in streaming data relies on a fast estimation of the probability that the data in two consecutive windows come from different distributions. Choosing the criterion is one of the multitude of questions that need to be addressed when designing a change detection procedure. This paper gives a log-likelihood justification for two well-known criteria for detecting change in streaming multidimensional data: Kullback-Leibler (K-L) distance and Hotelling's T-square test for equal means (H). We propose a semiparametric log-likelihood criterion (SPLL) for change detection. Compared to the existing log-likelihood change detectors, SPLL trades some theoretical rigor for computation simplicity. We examine SPLL together with K-L and H on detecting induced change on 30 real data sets. The criteria were compared using the area under the respective Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). SPLL was found to be on the par with H and better than K-L for the nonnormalized data, and better than both on the normalized data.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel self-supervised online learning method to discover driving behaviors from data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a camera. Both sensors where mounted in a car that was driven by a human through a typical city environment with intersections, pedestrian crossings and traffic lights. The presented system extracts motion segments from the IMU data and relates them to visual cues obtained from camera data. It employs a Bayesian on-line estimation method to discover the motion segments based on change-point detection and uses a Dirichlet Compound Multinomial (DCM) model to represent the visual features extracted from the camera images. By incorporating these visual cues into the on-line estimation process, labels are computed that are equal for similar motion segments. As a result, typical traffic situations such as braking maneuvers in front of a red light can be identified automatically. Furthermore, appropriate actions in form of observed motion changes are associated to the discovered traffic situations. The approach is evaluated on a real data set acquired in the center of Zurich.},
